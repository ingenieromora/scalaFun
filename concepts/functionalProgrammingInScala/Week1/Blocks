It is a good practice to show only the functions that needs to be shown to the user.
Auxiliary functions should not be shown to the final user.

For that we can use *blocks*

We have 2 intuitive principles:
1) The variables outside the block can be accessible inside the block
2) The same variable inside the block _shows_ the inside block

Exercise Â¿ Which is the result of the variable _result_?
```Scala

val x = 0

def f(y: Int) = y +1

val result = {
  val x = f(3);
  x * x
} + x

```
The result is: 16
