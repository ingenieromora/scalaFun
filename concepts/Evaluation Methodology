Expression Evaluation:
---------------------

1) Take the leftmost operator
2) Evaluate its operands (left before right)
3) Apply the operator to the operands


(2 * pi) * radius

(2 * 3.14159) * radius

6.28318 * radius

6.283818 * 10

62.8318


Call By Value:
-------------------

def sumOfSquares(x: Double, y:Double) = square(x) + square(y)


sumOfSquares(3, 2+2)

sumOfSquares(3, 4)

square(3) + square(4)

3 * 3 + square(4)

9 + 4 * 4

9 + 16

25


Call By Name:
-------------------
* apply the function to unreduced arguments

sumOfSquares(3, 2+2)

square(3) + square(2+2)

3 * 3 + square(2+2)

9 + (2+2) * (2+2)

9 + 4 * (2+2)

9 + 4 * 4

9 + 16

25

* Both strategies reduce to the same final value as long as
  > the reduced consists of pure functions, and
  > both evaluation terminate.
